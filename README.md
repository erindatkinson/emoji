# Emoji

This repo is a collection of emojis from slacks I've been in. Emoji images can be found in the `output` directory, and if you'd rather pull the list on your own, they are kept in the `lists` dir. Browsing in GitHub is difficult, so the `docs` dir has a series of pages with emoji tables on them.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python3 installed
* pipenv installed

## Usage

This repo uses the download script from [gist:lmarkus/lmarkus](https://gist.github.com/lmarkus/8722f56baf8c47045621#file-download-sh) to download as the repo itself is more for collection purposes.
