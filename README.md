# Emoji

This repo is a collection of emojis from slacks I've been in. Emoji images can be found in the `output` directory, and if you'd rather pull the list on your own, they are kept in the `lists` dir. Browsing in GitHub is difficult, so the `docs` dir has a series of pages with emoji tables on them.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python3 installed
* pipenv installed

## Usage

This repo uses the download script from [gist:lmarkus/lmarkus](https://gist.github.com/lmarkus/8722f56baf8c47045621#file-download-sh) to download as the repo itself is more for collection purposes.

The current way that has been working is to go to the webapp of the slack team, and pull the token from one of the requests and using the [api test page](https://api.slack.com/methods/emoji.list/test) to download the emoji list directly.
